## Task 01: Linear Regression for House Prices

**Objective:** Predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

**Files:**
- `house_prices.csv` - Dataset containing house features and prices.
- `linear_regression.py` - Python script implementing the linear regression model.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure the `house_prices.csv` file is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python linear_regression.py
    ```

## Task 02: K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

**Objective:** Group customers based on their purchase history.

**Files:**
- `customer_data.csv` - Dataset containing customer purchase data.
- `kmeans_clustering.py` - Python script implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure the `customer_data.csv` file is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python kmeans_clustering.py
    ```

## Task 03: SVM for Image Classification

**Objective:** Classify images of cats and dogs.

**Files:**
- `path_to_image_dataset` - Directory containing images of cats and dogs, organized by class.
- `svm_image_classification.py` - Python script implementing the SVM model for image classification.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure the image dataset is in the specified directory.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python svm_image_classification.py
    ```

## Task 04: Hand Gesture Recognition

**Objective:** Recognize and classify hand gestures from images or video data.

**Files:**
- `hand_gesture_data` - Directory containing labeled images of different hand gestures.
- `hand_gesture_recognition.py` - Python script for training a hand gesture recognition model.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure the hand gesture dataset is in the specified directory.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python hand_gesture_recognition.py
    ```

## Task 05: Food Item Recognition and Calorie Estimation

**Objective:** Recognize food items and estimate their calorie content from images.

**Files:**
- `food_images` - Directory containing labeled images of various food items.
- `food_recognition.py` - Python script for training a model to recognize food items and estimate calories.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure the food images dataset is in the specified directory.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python food_recognition.py
    ```
